### Builds a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of how it responds to changes in input size. It provides a way to classify algorithms based on their efficiency and scalability.

In Big O notation, functions are used to represent the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity or space complexity. It describes the worst-case scenario, indicating the maximum amount of time or space an algorithm will require as the size of the input grows.

Here are some common Big O complexities:

1. **O(1)**: Constant time complexity. The algorithm's performance is independent of the input size.
2. **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity. The algorithm's performance increases logarithmically as the input size grows.
3. **O(n)**: Linear time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows linearly with the input size.
4. **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows in proportion to the input size multiplied by the logarithm of the input size.
5. **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows quadratically with the input size.
6. **O(2^n)**: Exponential time complexity. The algorithm's performance doubles with each additional input element.
7. **O(n!)**: Factorial time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows factorially with the input size.

Big O notation allows developers to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms without getting bogged down in the details of hardware or software implementation. It helps in making informed decisions about algorithm selection and optimization based on the specific requirements of an application.

### Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is a binary tree with the property that the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any key stored in the right sub-tree.

Here are some key characteristics of a Binary Search Tree:

1. **Ordered or Sorted Binary Tree**: The left sub-tree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key. The right sub-tree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. Both the left and right sub-trees must also be binary search trees.

2. **Unique Entries**: No two nodes in the tree can have the same key or data value. This property makes binary search trees suitable for dictionary problems where the tree structure is used to provide quick search, insert and delete operations.

3. **Flexible Size**: The number of nodes in a binary search tree can dynamically increase or decrease as entries are added or removed.

4. **Efficient Operations**: Binary search trees are designed to enable efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. These operations can usually be performed in O(log n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Here are the basic operations that can be performed on a Binary Search Tree:

- **Search**: Starting from the root, we traverse the tree. If the current node is null, the key we are searching for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the current node's key equals the key we are searching for, we return the node. If the current node's key is less than our key, we search the right subtree. Otherwise, we search the left subtree.

- **Insertion**: Starting from the root, we traverse the tree. If the tree is empty, the new node becomes the root. Otherwise, we search the tree. If the key we are inserting is less than the current node's key, we go to the left child. If it is greater, we go to the right child. When we reach a null node, we insert the new node.

- **Deletion**: There are three cases to consider when deleting a node:
  - The node to be deleted is a leaf (has no children). In this case, we just remove the node from the tree.
  - The node to be deleted has one child. In this case, we elevate the child to the position of the parent.
  - The node to be deleted has two children. This is the most complex case. We need to find the in-order predecessor or the in-order successor of the node and replace the node with it. Then, we delete the in-order predecessor or successor, which will now be a node with at most one child.

- **Traversal**: There are three common ways to traverse a BST:
  - In-order traversal: Traverse the left subtree, visit the root, then traverse the right subtree.
  - Pre-order traversal: Visit the root, traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree.
  - Post-order traversal: Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, then visit the root.

These operations make the Binary Search Tree an effective data structure for many problems where the data needs to be stored in a sorted manner and the data is constantly being inserted or deleted.

Here's a simple visual representation of a Binary Search Tree (BST):

```
        8
       / \
      3   10
     / \    \
    1   6    14
       / \   /
      4   7 13
```

In this Binary Search Tree:

- `8` is the root of the tree.
- `3` and `10` are the children of `8`. `3` is the left child (because `3 < 8`), and `10` is the right child (because `10 > 8`).
- Similarly, for node `3`, `1` is the left child and `6` is the right child.
- Node `10` has `14` as its right child.
- Node `6` has `4` and `7` as its left and right child respectively.
- Node `14` has `13` as its left child.

This tree satisfies the property of a Binary Search Tree: for any given node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node.


### Real-world examples of Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are used in many real-world applications due to their efficient search, insert, and delete operations. Here are a few examples:

1. **Database Systems**: BSTs are used in database systems to speed up the process of finding, inserting, and deleting records. The keys represent record IDs, and the values are the records themselves. Because BSTs maintain their keys in sorted order, they can perform these operations quickly, which is crucial for large databases.

2. **File Systems**: Similar to database systems, file systems use BSTs to locate files quickly. The keys could represent file names, and the values could be the file data or metadata.

3. **Autocomplete Features**: Many applications (like search engines or text editors) that offer autocomplete functionality use BSTs. As the user types, the application performs a search in the BST to find and suggest completions based on the current input.

4. **Network Routers**: Routers use BSTs to route packets to their destination IP addresses. The IP addresses are the keys in the BST, and the values are the next hop information.

5. **Game Trees**: In game theory, BSTs can be used to construct game trees which represent the possible moves in a game. The nodes of the tree represent game states, and the edges represent moves.

6. **Ranking Systems**: In ranking systems like those used in sports or competitive programming, BSTs can be used to quickly determine the rank of an individual or team. The keys in the BST could represent scores or times, and the values could be the individuals or teams.

Remember, in all these examples, the BST property must hold: every node's key must be larger than all keys in its left subtree and smaller than all keys in its right subtree.

### Some common operations performed on a Binary Search Tree

Common operations performed on a Binary Search Tree (BST) include:

1. **Search**: This operation is used to check if a key exists in the BST. It starts from the root and compares the key with the current node. If the key is less than the current node, it moves to the left child. If the key is greater, it moves to the right child. This process continues until the key is found or the end of the tree is reached.

2. **Insertion**: This operation is used to add a new key to the BST. Similar to the search operation, it starts from the root and finds the appropriate location to insert the new key. If the new key is less than the current node, it moves to the left child. If the new key is greater, it moves to the right child. This process continues until a null node is reached, where the new key is inserted.

3. **Deletion**: This operation is used to remove a key from the BST. There are three cases to consider when deleting a node:
   - The node to be deleted is a leaf (has no children). In this case, we just remove the node from the tree.
   - The node to be deleted has one child. In this case, we elevate the child to the position of the parent.
   - The node to be deleted has two children. This is the most complex case. We need to find the in-order predecessor or the in-order successor of the node and replace the node with it. Then, we delete the in-order predecessor or successor, which will now be a node with at most one child.

4. **Traversal**: There are three common ways to traverse a BST:
   - In-order traversal: Traverse the left subtree, visit the root, then traverse the right subtree.
   - Pre-order traversal: Visit the root, traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree.
   - Post-order traversal: Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, then visit the root.

5. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**: The minimum key in a BST is the leftmost leaf node, and the maximum key is the rightmost leaf node. These operations can be performed by traversing the tree from the root to the leftmost or rightmost leaf, respectively.

6. **Finding Successor and Predecessor**: The successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the node's key. The predecessor of a node is the node with the largest key smaller than the node's key. These operations are useful in many algorithms that operate on BSTs.
